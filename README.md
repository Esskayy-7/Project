Folder containing projects I do with python

After spending some time learning the basic syntax of Python, and now learning the basic concepts of problem solving, I have done some projects to practice what I know and put them to use. The project file uploaded here will be very basic, and foundational, and then I will later build up to working on more complex concepts.
